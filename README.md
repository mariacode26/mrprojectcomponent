## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

For this project, I could learn about flexbox. a really cool attribute that lets you make a page responsive. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
section{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top:10%;  
}
```


### Continued development

I'll continue digging into css flexbox and for the next project I'll learn about css grid to apply to a new page, then start with javascript.


### Useful resources
